# Arithmetic-Calculator
Hi, this is a simple arithmetic calculator made using pure HTML, CSS and a little bit of JavaScript for learning purposes. I practiced a lot of HTML, CSS styling, responsiveness using media queries, and JS DOM manipulation and the use of functions. Thanks for checking it out.
